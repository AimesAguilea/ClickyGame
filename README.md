# ClickyGame

## Overview: 

Clicky app is a React 'memory' app. It's a simple game of remembering images that you clicked on.

## Tech used:

React

## How the app works:

12 images are rendered onto the page. Your Top Score and a Current Score are displayed at the top of the screen, which resets if you refresh the page. You are asked to click on an image, and when you do, your curren score goes up by one and the images 'shuffle' around on the page. The idea is to click on an image that you have not selected before to raise your current score while trying to remember which images you have already selected, avoiding those. If you select a image that you have already selected, your current score stops and chnages to the new top score and the game resets.
